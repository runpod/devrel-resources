# RunPod DevRel Resources

This repository is a central hub for sharing workflows, configurations, guides, and other resources created by the RunPod DevRel team for the community.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide practical, ready-to-use examples and materials that complement our tutorials, videos, and blog posts, helping users leverage RunPod effectively for various AI/ML tasks.

## Structure

The repository is organized by software or platform. Each top-level folder (e.g., `comfyui`) contains subfolders for specific resources.

## Conventions

We aim for consistency across all shared resources. Please refer to the [**Resource Conventions**](./docs/conventions.md) document for details on the standard structure and `README.md` format expected within each resource subfolder.
